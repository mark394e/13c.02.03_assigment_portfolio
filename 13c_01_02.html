            In the second assignment we were tasked with creating and using CSS variables so it
            would make it easier to change the color scheme or to make a dark mode version of our
            side. I chose a combination of darker version of paper white and some light and dark
            green as a contrast. We were also tasked with creating animations to highten the user
            experience. I made a scroll bar at the top of the website to show how far you have
            scrolled on the website and how much of the website is left. I also made a jiggle-effect
            on the CTA-button in the header to attract attention from the user. Finally I made an
            underline-swipe-effect from left to right on my links to indicate that they were in fact
            links. You can see my solution
